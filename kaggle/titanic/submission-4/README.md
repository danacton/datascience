This is a Fourth attempt at [Kaggle titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

#Method
- Use a random forest to predict survival or not
- Feature engineering
  - as per submission 3
- Data cleaning
  - As per submission 3
- Data factorization
  - As per submission 3
- Decision Tree
  - random forest with 1000 estimators

#Outcomes and observations
- Score is 0.72727
- Interestingly, the prediction is less accurate than submission 3. Perhaps that indicates that I was not overfitting that model.
